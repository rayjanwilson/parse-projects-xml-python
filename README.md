## Parse the projects with Python

Where all the projects reside -
E:\CPV

This is one folder of a node in one project -

E:\CPV\LAMETRO_impexp_lametro_CPV_ARCADIA
E:\CPV\LAMETRO_impexp_lametro_CPV_BELLFLOWER_1
E:\CPV\LAMETRO_impexp_lametro_CPV_BOWCROFT_1

The parts that I have bolded are called nodes.  So for example, there are 38 nodes (or different folders with the name LAMETRO in that group.

There are also projects named -

E:\CPV\TEXMEX_impexp_CPV_HUB_AL = TEXMEX
E:\CPV\twckc_impexp_CPV_HUB_GD = twckc
E:\CPV\TWCO_impexp_CPV_HUB_CB
